# perl6-CSS3-Selectors

This module extends CSS::Grammar::CSS3, implementing CSS Selectors Module Level 3.

CSS3::Selectors is a base grammar for CSS::Module::CSS3. It is a lighweight distribution that depends
only on CSS::Grammar and is useful when just CSS3 level selectors are required, but not the full power
(or dependencies are needed).

Some of the key syntax extensions are:

- 'not()' psuedo function `:not(.mammal)`
