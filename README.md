# perl6-CSS3-Selectors
This is a lightweight module extends CSS::Grammar::CSS3, implementing just CSS Selectors Module Level 3.

CSS3::Selectors is a base grammar for CSS::Module::CSS3. It depends
only on CSS::Grammar and is useful when just CSS3 level selectors are required, but not the full power
(or dependencies are needed).
